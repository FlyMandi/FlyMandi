## Resolution

Display Resolution, or Pixel Count, can be understood as the canvas size for a Display. In most cases, Displays have a fixed place for each pixel, physically. 

### Display resolutions and names

Resolutions are usually called by their vertical pixel count. "480p", for example. The problem with this approach is that "480p" can either mean 640x480, which has an aspect ratio of 4:3, or 854x480, its 16:9 equivalent. They can also be called "SD" or "Standard Definition", as if it wasn't confusing enough. So, for example, "SD Widescreen" is the same as "480p 16:9".

Here's a fairly exhaustive list of Display Resolutions:

- `4:3` Aspect Ratio:
    - `160x120`, other names: QQVGA or Quarter Quarter VGA;
    - `320x240`, other names: QVGA or Quarter VGA;
    - `480x320`, other names: HVGA or Half-size VGA; The first iPhone used this resolution.
    - `640x480`, other names: VGA, SD, Standard Definition; that name stems from the [VGA]() Standard Resolution.
    - `800x600`, other names: SVGA or Super VGA;
    - `1024x768`, other names: XGA or eXtended Graphics Array; 
    - `1152x864`, other names: XGA+ or eXtended Graphics Array Plus;
    - `2048x1536`, other names: QXGA or Quad XGA;
    - `3200x2400`, other names: QUXGA or Quad Ultra XGA;


- `16:9` Aspect Ratio, other names: Widescreen:
    - `256x144`, other names: 144p; Youtube's lowest supported [transcode](../01%20-%20BIOS%20&%20OS/File%20Types.md#transcoding) resolution.
    - `320x240`, other names: 240p;
    - `640x360`, other names: 360p;
    - `854x480`, other names: 480p, SD or Standard Definition; The Widescreen VGA equivalent.
    - `960x540`, other names: qHD or quarter HD;
    - `1280x720`, other names: 720p, HD or High Definition; The most common resolution in the late 2000s.
    - `1366x768`, sometimes called 768p; The 16:9 XGA equivalent; Still found in some not-that-old budget laptops, like the 2015 Acer Aspire 3 (that I happen to own, lol).
    - `1920x1080`, other names: 1080p, FHD or Full HD; the most common resolution throughout the 2010s.
    - `2560x1440`, other names: 1440p, QHD or Quad HD; exactly 4x the size of HD and 100x the size of 144p. Sometimes called 'WQHD' just to distinguish from qHD.


- `32:9` Aspect Ratio, also called "Ultrawide":

### Progressive Scan vs. Interlaced

The difference between 1080p and 1080i is not that the "p" in "1080p" stands for the word "pixels", but rather "Progressive Scan".

# Display Technologies

## HDR

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a technology that makes it possible to have an image "pop", by achieving very deep blacks (or completely turned off pixels) and very bright Highlights, one next to another, if needed. HDR was not needed for a CRT, since CRTs can just choose not to illuminate a pixel, so their percieved Dynamic Range was already high from the get-go. They can't quite compare to a modern wOLED panel though, because CRTs just don't get bright enough (usually around a couple hundred nits at most).
