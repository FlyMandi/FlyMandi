## Welcome.

I like to code (duh), particularly interested in Low-Level coding such as Game Engine Programming with C++. 

I have a healthy obsession with figuring out how stuff works under the hood.

Also very passionate about automation, I know PowerShell quite well and often automate tasks I find myself doing often.
