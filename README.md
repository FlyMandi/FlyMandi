## Welcome.

I like to code (duh), particularly interested in Low-Level Graphics programming.

I have a healthy obsession with figuring out how stuff works under the hood; I like to build things from scratch, not only to learn, but also to build my own tools.

Also very passionate about task automation and the CLI.

I mainly focus on the development of [River](https://github.com/FlyMandi/River), a cross-platform 3D Graphics engine.
