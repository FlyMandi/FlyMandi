## Welcome.

I like to code (duh), particularly interested in Low-Level game and game engine programming.

I have a healthy obsession with figuring out how stuff works under the hood;
I like to build things from scratch, not only to learn, but also to build my own tools.

Also very passionate about operating systems and hardware.

Platforms listed below never include macOS because I have no interest in acquiring it to verify compatibility.
In principle however, if `Windows + Linux` is specified, you can try your luck with building the project on macOS so long as the APIs/SDKs are supported.
