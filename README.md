## Welcome.
This is a collection of repositories of my personal projects. Most of these serve the greater purpose of deepening my understanding of how stuff works and how to build said stuff.
There are, however, some projects that you might find useful or intriguing, like PowerShell Scripts to automate things I do often within Windows.
