# Why Godot?

Godot is a fairly capable engine with support for C++, which I'm going to be using to build my games. There are possibilities of using GDScript, VisualScript or C#, but personally, I like control over a lot of the performance, hence I'm going to be using C++ with GDNative, which is their way of integrating C and C++ code into Godot projects.
