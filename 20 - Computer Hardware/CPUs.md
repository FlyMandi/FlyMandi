## Pins

### PGA

Pin-Grid-Array (PGA) Processors have pins on the CPU, connecting to pads in the motherboard socket, each pin carrying its own signal. The more pins, the more signals can be sent to different places in the same clock cycle.

### LGA

Land-Grid-Array (LGA) Processors don't have any pins, but rather contact pads on the CPU itself, because the pins are in the Motherboard Socket. 

### Other

There are, however, alternatives to PGA & LGA: soldering. An embedded CPU that's fully soldered to the Motherboard is mostly found in Laptops and other thin devices where a CPU switch is not expected, such as a Raspberry Pi. The advantage of soldering a CPU to a board are, for example, not having to manufacture a socket and not having to worry about pins ever breaking- because there are no pins.
