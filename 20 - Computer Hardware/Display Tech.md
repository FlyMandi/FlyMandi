## Display Features

### HDR

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a technology that makes it possible to have an image "pop", by achieving very deep blacks (or completely turned off pixels) and very bright Highlights, one next to another, if needed. HDR was not needed for a CRT, since CRTs can just choose not to illuminate a pixel, so their percieved Dynamic Range was already high from the get-go. They can't quite compare to a modern wOLED panel though, because CRTs just don't get bright enough (usually around a couple hundred nits at most).
