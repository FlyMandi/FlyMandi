# Introduction

A file type can be understood as a heads-up to the PC on how to read said file. If no format exists, the file is essentially just a bunch of 1s and 0s in sequence, with no information given on how to read said bits. The format can be thought of as a template, telling the PC which bits exactly correspond to what. For example, the first couple bytes in an image file might be metadata, like resolution and timestamp of the image, which isn't to be included in the actual colour data of the image. After that, every byte might correspond to a pixel, indicating [RGB](../00%20-%20Hardware/Displays.md) values.
