# What is a File Format?

A file type, file format or file extension can be understood as a heads-up to the PC on how to read said file. If no format exists, the file is essentially just a bunch of 1s and 0s in sequence, with no information given on how to read said bits. The format can be thought of as a template, telling the PC which bits exactly correspond to what. For example, the first couple bytes in an image file might be metadata, like resolution and timestamp of the image, which isn't to be included in the actual colour data of the image. After that, every byte might correspond to a pixel, indicating [RGB](../00%20-%20Hardware//Displays.md#rgb) values, et voil√†, your PC can show you an image.

Note: a file extension is not _required_ to read a file, if whatever's reading the file knows exactly which file type/codec to expect from it. This is commonly seen when updating a BIOS, which is usually renamed to a file without an extension, since the OS itself doesn't need to read it and the BIOS itself is not reading any other files.
